#Client Side Caching

#Introduction
Caching is a useful feature to improve the responsiveness of an application. By using caching on the GWT client, we can save a lot of round-trips to the server since much of the required data is static in nature, considering the lifetime of a web page (on average, a maximum of 4-6 days).

This feature builds upon ClientActionHandlers, and therefore it is suggested to read that first.
